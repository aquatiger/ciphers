# ciphers

Project is intended to draw the numbering system I discovered from David King about the ciphers of the Cistercian Monks.
This numbering system originated in Greece, apparently, but modified, after disuse, by the monks.

It is just a compact, wonderful system for numbers, that any number less than 10,000 can be represented by a single "character".

User inputs a number and python turtle draws the cipher.

The color of the cipher and the color of the background are randomized now, so each time is a different color for both.
