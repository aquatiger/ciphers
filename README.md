# ciphers

Project is intended to draw the numbering system I discovered from David A. King about the ciphers of the Cistercian Monks.
This numbering system originated in Greece, apparently, but modified after disuse by the monks.

It is just a compact, wonderful system for numbers, that any number less than 10,000 can be represented by a single "character".

Plan on writing so user inputs a number and python turtle draws the cipher.

Initial commit just got each of the parts designed.
